    Pipeline:
      1. Patchify with `PatchEmbeddings`.
      2. Prepend a learnable [CLS] token.
      3. Add a learnable positional embedding of shape (1, num_patches+1, d_model).
      4. Pass the sequence through `num_blocks` Transformer Blocks
         (with is_decoder=False).
      5. Apply a final LayerNorm.
      6. Return only the [CLS] slice — shape (B, d_model).

    For §5 (VLM), you may want a `return_all_tokens=True` flag that returns the
    full (B, num_patches+1, d_model) sequence instead. Add it when you get there.
