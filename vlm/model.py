"""Vision-Language Model — §5.

You implement: VisionLanguageModel.

Three injection strategies to support:
  - "cls":          Single visual token (the ViT's CLS embedding) prepended.
  - "all_patches":  All N+1 visual tokens (CLS + patches) prepended.
  - "interleaved":  A special <image> token in the prompt is replaced by the
                    sequence of patch embeddings at runtime.

Two attention masking strategies to support (Problem `masking`):
  - "causal":         Fully causal across the whole sequence.
  - "image_bidir":    Bidirectional within the image block, causal everywhere
                      else. Use vlm.masking.build_image_bidir_mask().

    Args:
        vit:       Your CLIP-pretrained ViT from §3.
        projector: vlm.projector.VisionLanguageProjector instance.
        decoder:   HuggingFace causal LM (e.g., SmolLM2-360M-Instruct) loaded
                   in bf16 with FlashAttention-2.
        tokenizer: Matching HF tokenizer.
        image_token_id: Token ID corresponding to the special <image> placeholder
                        in interleaved mode (None for cls / all_patches modes).

    Forward:
        images:         (B, 3, H, W) float tensor.
        input_ids:      (B, T) tokenized text.
        attention_mask: (B, T) text attention mask from the tokenizer.
        labels:         (B, T) for loss computation, or None for inference.
                        Visual-token positions must be set to -100 in labels
                        before being passed in (so they're masked out by HF's
                        loss).
        injection:      One of "cls", "all_patches", "interleaved".
        mask_mode:      One of "causal", "image_bidir".

    Returns:
        A dict with at least:
          - "loss":   scalar (only if labels was provided).
          - "logits": (B, T_total, vocab_size).
